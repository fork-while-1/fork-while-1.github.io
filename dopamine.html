        <span id="para">Dope, I'm addicted</span><br>

        Dopamine is a "feel-good" <b>neuro-transmitter</b> (a chemical in your blood), and is typically released when you do things that you find enjoyable (play video-games, eat sugary/fried shit, have sex, do meth, etc). 
        Whenever dopamine is release into the blood-stream, it finds its way to <b>dopamine receptors</b> located in the brain, and binds to them.
        The dopamine binding to the receptor is what causes you to feel pleasure.
        <br><br>

        It sucks, but dopamine also has another dangerous quality&mdash;this is the neuro-transmitter associated with most addictive activities. 
        This is because it activates our brain's "reward" center, wherein when you do something your brain views as awesome, it rewards you with dopamine to make you feel good about it. 
        You then mentally correlate that activity that causes the dopamine release with feeling great, and this is what forms the habit. 
        And when this cycle gets too intense, it basically becomes an addiction. 
        <br><br>

        <span id="para">The problem</span><br>

        When you do too much of something that causes a dopamine release (e.g., eating junk), your brain adapts in two ways: <br> 
        a) It reduces the number of dopamine receptors in the brain, <br> 
        b) It releases less dopamine in response to that activity. <br>
        Either of these mean that you no longer derive as much pleasure from the activity as you initially did--which typically means you need to do more of it to get the same pleasure.
        This is how people develop addictions, and it eventually wreaks havoc on how dopamine is managed in your body. 
        <br><br>
        
        And this is a problem. A big problem, because aside from several other functions critical for survival, dopamine is the main driver of ambition. 
        <br><br>

        Obviously, how much you mess up depends on what you did in the first place--for e.g., being addicted to chocolate isn't the same as being addicted to meth.
        Meth (and other dopaminergic drugs like coke, heroin, MDMA, etc) have a long list of horrible long term side-effects, but even seemingly "okay" addictions--like junk food, or video games, affect us over time. 
        <br><br>

        It slowly, but surely, desensitizes you to dopamine's effects, so that the "feel good" you used to have from, say, completing an assignment just doesn't feel as good anymore, because you've trained your brain to need more dopamine to feel any pleasure.
        Addictive activities often also don't take any real-effort (e.g., snorting coke or stuffing your face with candy isn't a lot of "work"), and so the deeper you get stuck in this cycle, the more you train your brain to get a dopamine hit without putting in any real effort.
        This also works against your ambition because you just don't feel like doing anything that takes effort anymore.
        And so, depending on the intensity of the addiction, other things in life seem to matter less and less and while this addictive activity takes over your life. <br><br>

        Crazy shit.

        <span id="para">Addictive personalities</span><br>

        Obviously, not everyone is the same--some folks are more predisposed to developing addictions (even "harmless" ones like food or games), than others.
        There could be many contributary factors (e.g., genetics) but it doesn't matter--you gotta play the hand you're dealt and deal with it.
        I personally think having an addictive personality means you're just extra sensitive to dopamine--which is honestly great news if you know how to use it! 
        Think about it, every great person out there had to have had some degree of obsession with what they're great at--whether it's a scientist or an athlete. 
        This type of mindset, if put to good use, is what leads to greatness.<br><br>

        <span id="para">"Hacking" dopamine</span><br>
        
        "Hacking" your dopamine response is key to being able to feel well and accomplish what you want to. 
        What I personally now do is lead a very dopamine conserved lifestyle--I don't like to "waste" my dopamine on things that I don't find fruitful for myself.
        <br><br> 
        
        This is one of the reasons I quit eating anything with added sugar--sugar causes an instant dopamine release, without having to put in much effort (other than having to stuff your face). 
        This is also why frequent masturbation isn't the best thing to be doing; you're just desensitizing yourself so when you get the real-deal, you won't enjoy it as much. 
        Or worse, you could become plain addicted to masturbating&mdash;I have definitely seen people who are 100% addicted, and it's not very pretty.
        <br><br>
        
        What I do like to do to get my dopamine is things that are: <br>
        a) valuable to me, and <br>
        b) have a negative feedback cycle. <br>
        Things that fall into the former category are arbitrary, and mostly depend on each individual's metric of "useful". 
        The latter is more well-defined. 
        It basically refers to things that you can't spiral out of control with. 
        A good example of this is exercise. 
        It gives you a good amount of dopamine; you can notice it if you do it long enough--after a while you'll start to need it to feel normal. However, it's very very hard to go overboard with exercise--don't get me wrong, over-exercising is not unheard of, but it's definitely not as common as things like overeating junk food. Plus exercise has a truckload of other benefits for your health, so it's a good thing to have a habit of.
        The other advantage of living a very dopamine-conserved lifestyle is that it encourages you to seek out dopamine through other things, for example, socializing and gaining new life experiences. I really value doing quirky things just for the thrill, and saving up on dopamine from other places means my introverted ass has more social energy to seek out new people and new adventures. I find that going on crazy adventures adds a pop of color to life, and doesn't make it as boring as it would otherwise be. It also gives you a more dynamic personality (and gives you more shit to talk about on dates). Some of my quirky hobbies are--trolling and pranking people, hacking random shit just for laughs, meeting new quirky people like me etc.
        Another useful thing to do is to never rely on just one source for dopamine. Because if that one thing is taken away from you, you'll feel absolutely misreable.

        <span id="para">Anhedonia</span><br>
        The more you abuse the dopaminergic system, the more you become desensitized to feeling pleasure. 
        When this gets really extreme, you end up with a condition called <b>Anhedonia</b>. <b>An</b> means without <b>hedonia</b> comes from the word hedonism, which refers to the act of doing things for the pleasure--\emph{Anhedonia} is the condition where you stop being able to experience pleasure from anything. 
        This typically happens to people who chronically abuse dopaminergic drugs (like Meth, Coke, Adderall, etc) or people who have diseases like Parkinsons. 
        I've never experienced it myself, but from what I've heard, it feels like nothing makes you happy anymore, and you're kind of just getting through life.
