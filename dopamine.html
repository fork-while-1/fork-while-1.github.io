        <br><br>

        Dopamine is a "feel-good" <b>neuro-transmitter</b> (a chemical in your blood), and is typically released when you do things that you find enjoyable (play video-games, eat sugary/fried shit, have sex, do meth, etc). 
        Whenever dopamine is release into the blood-stream, it finds its way to <b>dopamine receptors</b> located in the brain, and binds to them.
        The dopamine binding to the receptor is what causes you to feel pleasure.
        <br><br>

        What sucks is that because of this, dopamine also has another dangerous quality&mdash;this is the neuro-transmitter associated with most addictive activities. 
        This is because it activates our brain's "reward" center, wherein when you do something your brain views as awesome, it rewards you with dopamine to make you feel good about it. 
        You then mentally correlate that activity that causes the dopamine release with feeling great, and this is what forms the habit. 
        And when this cycle gets too intense, it basically becomes an addiction. 
        <br><br>

        <span id="para">The problem</span>
        <br><br>

        When you do too much of something that causes a dopamine release (e.g., alcohol, meth, eating junk food, etc), it leads to several issues: <br>
        a) First, let's dicuss what happens acutely when you get a dopamine rush. 
        Dopamine is an exictatory neuro-transmitter, and so large rush of dopamine in a very short amount of time causes neurons (brain cells) to die.
        This, obviously, is most likely to happen with very strong <b>dopamine agonists</b> (something that promotes dopamine), for e.g., amphetamines like meth.
        The problem with this is that brain injury is very hard to recover from, and so it's really a downward slope for most people.
        And when, over time, you lose a large fraction of your dopaminergic neurons, you develop Parkinson's disease.
        This is precisely why chronic meth abusers are much more likely than the average person to develop Parkinson's.
        Obviously, excitotoxicity is less likely to happen with weaker dopamine agonists like junk food, for example, but that isn't to say they don't have longer term effects. 
        This brings me to my next points. Chronic abuse of the <b>dopaminergic</b> (dopamine releasing) activities your brain adapts in two ways: <br> 
        b) It reduces the number of dopamine receptors in the brain, <br> 
        c) It releases less dopamine in response to that activity. <br>
        Either of these mean that you no longer derive as much pleasure from the activity as you initially did&mdash;which typically means you need to do more of it to get the same pleasure.
        This is how people develop addictions, and it eventually wreaks havoc on how dopamine is managed in your body. 
        <br><br>
        
        And this is a problem. A big problem, because aside from several other functions critical for survival (e.g., motor functions, decision making, etc), dopamine is the main driver of ambition. 
        <br><br>

        Obviously, how much you mess up depends on what you did in the first place&mdash;for e.g., being addicted to chocolate isn't the same as being addicted to meth.
        Meth (and other dopaminergic drugs like coke, heroin, MDMA, etc) have a long list of horrible long term side-effects, but even seemingly "okay" addictions&mdash;like junk food, or video games, affect us over time. 
        <br><br>

        They slowly, but surely, desensitize you to dopamine's effects, so that the "feel good" you used to have from, say, completing an assignment just doesn't feel as good anymore, because you've trained your brain to need more dopamine to feel any pleasure.
        Addictive activities often also don't take any real effort (e.g., snorting coke or stuffing your face with candy isn't a lot of "work"), and so the deeper you get stuck in this cycle, the more you train your brain to get a dopamine hit without putting in any real effort.
        This also works against your ambition because you feel less inclined to doing anything that takes effort when you have your rely on other "stuff".
        And so, depending on the intensity of the addiction, other things in life seem to matter less and less and while this addictive activity takes over you. <br><br>

        Crazy shit.

        <span id="para">Addictive personalities</span>
        <br><br>

        Obviously, not everyone is the same&mdash;some folks are more predisposed to developing addictions (even "harmless" ones like food or video games), than others.
        There could be many contributary factors (e.g., genetics, your environment) but it doesn't matter&mdash;you have to play the hand you're dealt and deal with it.
        I personally think having an addictive personality means you're just extra sensitive to dopamine&mdash;which is great news if you know how to use it. 
        It's just a matter of choosing what you get addicted to&mdash;something useless that will harm you in the long term, or something useful.
        Think about it, every great person out there had to have had some degree of obsession with what they're great at&mdash;whether it's a scientist or an athlete. 
        Look at Eliud Kipchoge&mdash;the world's fastest marathoner. 
        The guy runs around 5 marathons <b>per week</b>, totalling to about <b>200+ miles a week</b>.
        This type of mindset, and the ability to grind, if put to good use, is what leads to greatness.<br><br>

        <span id="para">"Hacking" dopamine</span><br>
        
        "Hacking" your dopamine response is key to being able to make dopamine work for you, rather than the other way around.
        You want to get rid of everything else that stimulates the dopamine system, so you have less dopamine floating around as a baseline.
        This will prime your system for anything even slightly dopaminergic, which will make it easier for you to form new habits.
        Then, you only want to do things that you want to develop a habit of, and because you stopped doing everything else that stimulates dopamine release, these new habits will be very strong.

        Using these principles, I personally lead a very dopamine conserved lifestyle&mdash;I don't like to "waste" my dopamine on things that I don't find fruitful for myself.
        <br><br>
        
        What I do like to do to get my dopamine is things that are: <br>
        a) valuable to me, and <br>
        b) have a negative feedback cycle. <br>
        Things that fall into the former category are arbitrary, and mostly depend on each individual's metric of "valuable". 
        The latter is more well-defined; it basically refers to things that you can't spiral out of control with.
        With this, I have a list of things that I do, and don't do for dopamine. 
        <br><br>

        <span id="para">Shit I do for dopamine</span>
        <br><br>

        a) <b>Intimacy</b>: This is obviously a no brainer. If you're into hookups, or have a relationship, congratulations!
        But if you're not into meaningless sex with random people you don't even vibe with, but aren't emotionally ready for a relationship either&mdash;welcome to my personal hell.
        Regardless of whatever your situation is, you should figure out an arrangement, find some big daddy who's going to be your source.
        <br><br>
        
        b) <b>The gym</b>: It gives you a good amount of dopamine (and morphine too). 
        You can notice it if you do it long enough&mdash;after a while you'll start to need exercise to feel normal. 
        However, it's very very hard to go overboard with exercise, so it's less likely you'll go into dangerous territories.  
        Plus exercise has a truckload of other benefits for your health, so it's a good thing to have a habit of.
        Finally, you'll probably like the vibe in the gym&mdash;put on some good music, work out, watch some gym daddies workout, pretty good stuff.
        If you're a newbie (and a girl), a lot of the gym daddies will be more than happy to help you out, too ;)
        <br><br>

        <!-- Also, seriously, if you're a girl and you don't go to a gym, you're missing out.
        Especially with weight-lifting.
        When I first started weight-lifting, I was terrified of seeing all the big, beefy dudes&mdash;I was very tiny in comparison.
        But soon, I realized that this is a goldmine&mdash;big daddies love helping out girls who need help ;)
        Trust me on this one, this actually does work.
        Plus hanging out with big daddies is also a great source of dopamine, so two birds with one stone. 
        <br><br> -->

        <!-- Perhaps the best anecdote I have of the benefits of going to a gym are was last summer, where the guy who managed the gym was one of the hottest people I'd ever seen.
        Like I looked at him and I thought "is it even legal for someone to be this hot?" 
        He was a bit awkward (was an engineering student before, so made sense&mdash;we're a pretty awkward bunch).
        Because of this, I figured if anyone had to make a move, it would have to be me.
        In hindsight, it wasn't the brightest idea, I was already seeing 3 other guys so it would have been more work to squeeze him in. 
        But anyways, most of my dating decisions are made in "fuck it" mode, so I tried to go for it regardless.
        So I went to the gym <b>every single day</b> with a plan of asking him out.
        I would talk to him, but sadly was too chicken to make a move. 
        But because I was so consistent at going, I got so much better at weight-lifting that summer.
        I felt like the kid who used the wrong formula to answer a question but still got the right answer, but hey, if it works, it works!
        <br><br> -->

        c) <b>Socializing</b>: Having a solid network of friends really adds a lot of value to life.
        I prioritize having deeper connections with a smaller group of people, rather than shallow ones with many&mdash;it feels nice to be really there for people, and to also have people in your corner when you need them.
        Go out there, make memories with your friends, and take pics! Fuck it, life is short so make sure you make the most of it. 
        <br><br>

        d) <b>Adventures:</b> When I look back at my life, I want to see myself having actually have had fun.
        And so I try doing as many crazy, stupid (but not too stupid), things that I can.
        Going to clubs to check out guys, hacking things just for laughs, going to underground hacker talks, messing around with friends, trolling people online, etc.
        <br><br>

        <!-- e) <b>Clubbing:</b> I usually go clubbing either with guys, or to check out guys, or to dance, and honestly all three of give you a very good dopamine release.
        <br><br>

        f) <b>Trolling and pranking:</b> Honestly, trolling people in online games, or in real life has to be one of the purest joys out there.
        <br><br> -->

        e) <b>Projects:</b> Doing small projects that have a well-defined endpoint.
        Remember, these are side-projects, so you need to make sure they're small, so you get your gratification soon.
        It needs to be something accomplishable, so you don't get disheartened midway.
        For instance, this blog is something I've been working on for quite a while, and it's meaningful to me&mdash;it makes me happy to be able to help others!
        I also crochet, do graphic designing, etc in my free time. 
        These are all skills that are of personal value to me and make me happy too.
        <br><br>
        
        f) <b>Goals:</b> I believe life has no inherent meaning&mdash;we attribute meaning to it through our goals.
        You need to have some direction in life at every moment for you to not feel lost.
        This direction doesn't necessarily have to be something static&mdash;it can change as your life changes.
        It merely needs to serve as a roadmap to guide you through life at <b>that</b> moment in time.
        When things change, so can your roadmap, but it's important to always have one to begin with.
        <br><br>

        Not all your life goals should be something that has an end, because once you reach that end you'll be faced with an existential crisis that's hard to handle.
        You need to have goals whose <b>journey</b> you enjoy, and not just the destination.
        For instance, one of my goals is to be able to run a 5 minute mile&mdash;I probably will never be able to accomplish it, but I love working towards it!
        Similarly, you should never have just one goal, or just one thing that gives your life meaning&mdash;if something bad happens with regards to this goal, you'll be left feeling lost.
        So have other goals to cushion yourself against this.

        <span id="para">Don't do this</span>
        <br><br>

        a) <b>Sugar: </b> I quit eating anything with added sugar&mdash;sugar causes an instant dopamine release, without having to put in much effort (other than having to stuff your face). 
        This is also why, when people are sad, they often "eat their feelings"&mdash;it gives you an instant dopamine hit.
        It also adds no value to life, other than giving a dopamine hit&mdash;so I see no reason why I should eat it.
        <br><br>
        
        b) <b>Masturbation:</b> If you masturbate too much, you're just desensitizing yourself so when you get the real-deal, you won't enjoy it as much. 
        Or worse, you could become plain addicted to masturbating&mdash;I have definitely seen people who are 100% addicted, and it's not very something you want. 
        <br><br>

        c) <b>Porn:</b> Same as b) pretty much 
        <br><br>

        d) <b>Processed food:</b> Highly processed foods are <b>made</b> to be addictive, so it's practically a losing battle with them.
        Plus it's horrible for your health, and if you do enough other fun things you don't really miss it.
        <br><br>

        e) <b>Drugs:</b> This is kind of obvious, but just adding it for completness sake.

        <span id="para">Addiction swapping</span>
        <br><br>

        People who get addicted to things easily often try to "solve" their addiction by swapping it with another addiction.
        For instance, some drug addicts who sober up sometimes become food addicts, or porn addicts, or something else to fill that void.
        This also happens with people who, for example, define their entire lives around their work&mdash;and then when eventually something unexpected happens there, they cannot handle it.
        As someone who is a little bit of a workaholic, I realized the key to truly solve your problems is to never rely on one source of dopamine in your life, because you'll always try to swap out one thing for another.
        Plus, this way, if that one source is taken away, you won't be absolutely wrecked.
        <br><br>

        <span id="para">Anhedonia</span>
        <br><br>

        The more you abuse the dopaminergic system, the more you become desensitized to feeling pleasure. 
        When this gets really extreme, you end up with a condition called <b>Anhedonia</b>. <b>An</b> means without, and <b>hedonia</b> comes from the word hedonism, which refers to the act of doing things for the pleasure&mdash;<b>Anhedonia</b> is the condition where you stop being able to experience pleasure from anything. 
        This typically happens to people who chronically abuse dopaminergic drugs (like Meth, Coke, Adderall, etc) or people who have diseases like Parkinsons. 
        I've never experienced it myself, but from what I've heard, it feels like nothing makes you happy anymore, and you're kind of just getting through life.
