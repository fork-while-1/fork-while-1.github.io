        <span id="para">Dope, I'm addicted</span>
        <br><br>

        Dopamine is a "feel-good" <b>neuro-transmitter</b> (a chemical in your blood), and is typically released when you do things that you find enjoyable (play video-games, eat sugary/fried shit, have sex, do meth, etc). 
        Whenever dopamine is release into the blood-stream, it finds its way to <b>dopamine receptors</b> located in the brain, and binds to them.
        The dopamine binding to the receptor is what causes you to feel pleasure.
        <br><br>

        What sucks is that because of this, dopamine also has another dangerous quality&mdash;this is the neuro-transmitter associated with most addictive activities. 
        This is because it activates our brain's "reward" center, wherein when you do something your brain views as awesome, it rewards you with dopamine to make you feel good about it. 
        You then mentally correlate that activity that causes the dopamine release with feeling great, and this is what forms the habit. 
        And when this cycle gets too intense, it basically becomes an addiction. 
        <br><br>

        <span id="prompt">fork-while-1@github.io<span id="colon">:</span><span id="tilda">~</span><span id="dolla">$</span></span> 
        <span id="para">The problem</span>
        <br><br>

        When you do too much of something that causes a dopamine release (e.g., alcohol, meth, eating junk food, etc), it leads to several issues: 
        <br><br>
        
        a) First, let's dicuss what happens acutely when you get a dopamine rush. 
        Dopamine is an exictatory neuro-transmitter, and so large rush of dopamine in a very short amount of time causes neurons (brain cells) to die.
        This, obviously, is most likely to happen with very strong <b>dopamine agonists</b> (something that promotes dopamine), for e.g., amphetamines like meth.
        The problem with this is that brain injury is very hard to recover from, and so it's really a downward slope for most people.
        And when, over time, you lose a large fraction of your dopaminergic neurons, you develop Parkinson's disease.
        This is precisely why chronic meth abusers are much more likely than the average person to develop Parkinson's.
        But don't worry, you have to lose a <b>lot</b> of dopaminergic neurons to develop Parkinson's, so if you quit at a reasonable time, you'll most likely be okay. 

        <br><br>

        Obviously, excitotoxicity is less likely to happen with weaker dopamine agonists like junk food, for example, but that isn't to say they don't have longer term effects. <br>
        This brings me to my next points. Chronic abuse of the <b>dopaminergic</b> (dopamine releasing) activities your brain adapts in two ways: <br> 
        b) It reduces the number of dopamine receptors in the brain, <br> 
        c) It releases less dopamine in response to that activity. <br>
        Either of these mean that you no longer derive as much pleasure from the activity as you initially did&mdash;which typically means you need to do more of it to get the same pleasure.
        This is how people develop addictions, and it eventually wreaks havoc on how dopamine is managed in your body. 
        <br><br>
        
        And this is a problem. A big problem, because aside from several other functions critical for survival (e.g., motor functions, decision making, etc), dopamine is the main driver of ambition. 
        <br><br>

        Obviously, how much you mess up depends on what you did in the first place&mdash;for e.g., being addicted to chocolate isn't the same as being addicted to meth.
        Meth (and other dopaminergic drugs like coke, heroin, MDMA, etc) have a long list of horrible long term side-effects, but even seemingly "okay" addictions&mdash;like junk food, or video games, affect us over time. 
        <br><br>

        They slowly, but surely, desensitize you to dopamine's effects, so that the "feel good" you used to have from, say, completing an assignment just doesn't feel as good anymore, because you've trained your brain to need more dopamine to feel any pleasure.
        Addictive activities often also don't take any real effort (e.g., snorting coke or stuffing your face with candy isn't a lot of "work"), and so the deeper you get stuck in this cycle, the more you train your brain to get a dopamine hit without putting in any real effort.
        This also works against your ambition because you feel less inclined to doing anything that takes effort when you have your rely on other "stuff".
        And so, depending on the intensity of the addiction, other things in life seem to matter less and less and while this addictive activity takes over you. <br><br>

        Crazy shit.
        <br><br>

        <span id="para">Addictive personalities</span>
        <br><br>

        Obviously, not everyone is the same&mdash;some folks are more predisposed to developing addictions (even "harmless" ones like food or video games), than others.
        There could be many contributary factors (e.g., genetics, trauma, etc) that explain why your brain is wired this way.
        A friend once told me, "you have to play the hand you're dealt", and I think this applies here as&mdash;you can't cure yourself, but you can certainly manage it.
        I personally think having an addictive personality means you're just extra sensitive to dopamine&mdash;
        This took me a while to realize, but this is also a blessing if you know how to use it. 
        It's just a matter of choosing what you get addicted to&mdash;something useless that will harm you in the long term, or something useful.
        Think about it, every great person out there had to have had some degree of obsession with what they're great at&mdash;whether it's a scientist or an athlete. 
        Look at Eliud Kipchoge&mdash;the world's fastest marathoner. 
        The guy runs around 5 marathons <b>per week</b>, totalling to about <b>200+ miles a week</b>.
        There are so many other examples of people who are legends in their field, and have been so because of their ability to channel themselves to what they want.
        This type of mindset, and the ability to grind, if put to good use, is what leads to greatness.
        <br><br>

        <span id="prompt">fork-while-1@github.io<span id="colon">:</span><span id="tilda">~</span><span id="dolla">$</span></span> 
        <span id="para">Do you fit the bill?</span>
        <br><br>

        If you're wondering whether or not you have an addictive personality, try answering the following questions: 
        <br><br>

        a) Are you an all or nothing type of person? 
        In other words, can you practice moderation? 
        For e.g., you tell yourself you're only going to eat two cookies, and actually eat just two (as opposed to the entire box)?
        Or you tell yourself you'll just play an hour of video games, and actually follow through with it?
        <br><br>

        b) If the previous point made you suspect you have a problem with something, try quitting it for two weeks.
        Don't tell yourself that "you can quit anytime you want"&mdash;actually go through with it.
        There's a saying: There were 3 frogs sitting on a log, and 1 frog decided to jump off the log. 
        How many frogs are left on the log? 
        The answer is 3, because decision is not the same as action. 
        Even if you make it through the two weeks, keep track of how mentally obsessed you were with the activity during those two weeks.
        <br><br>

        If, after this, you think you might have a problem, you may want to do something about it.
        If this is a major issue (e.g., substance abuse), you could go to rehab, and also join support groups.

        <span id="para">"Hacking" dopamine</span>
        <br><br>
        
        "Hacking" your dopamine response is key to being able to make dopamine work for you, rather than the other way around.
        You want to get rid of everything else that stimulates the dopamine system, so you have less dopamine floating around as a baseline.
        This will prime your system for anything even slightly dopaminergic, which will make it easier for you to form new habits.
        Then, you only want to do things that you want to develop a habit of, and because you stopped doing everything else that stimulates dopamine release, these new habits will be very strong.
        There is most likely going to be a lag period, so you won't feel great for a while when you quit your old habits and try to develop new ones.
        But still, try to stick with it&mdash;it's worth it.

        Using these principles, I personally lead a very dopamine conserved lifestyle&mdash;I don't like to "waste" my dopamine on things that I don't find fruitful for myself.
        <br><br>
        
        What I do like to do to get my dopamine is things that are: <br>
        a) valuable to me, and <br>
        b) have a negative feedback cycle. <br>
        Things that fall into the former category are arbitrary, and mostly depend on each individual's metric of "valuable". 
        The latter is more well-defined; it basically refers to things that you can't spiral out of control with.
        With this, I have a list of things that I do, and don't do for dopamine. 
        <br><br>

        <span id="para">Stuff to do for dopamine</span>
        <br><br>

        a) <b>Guys</b>: This is obviously a no brainer. If you're into hookups, or have a relationship, congratulations!
        But if you're not into meaningless sex with random people you don't even vibe with, but aren't emotionally ready for a relationship either&mdash;welcome to my personal hell.
        Regardless,  whatever your situation is, you should figure out an arrangement, find some big daddy who's going to be your source.
        But in the meantime, you can swoon over Maverick and Slider from Top Gun, and remember how nice it used to be to feel flames.
        I could go on with more "when it's been too long" jokes, but wanted to keep this PG.
        Regardless, if anyone has better suggestions than this, please tell me (unless it's to get a cat&mdash;a surprising number of people have told me to get a cat, and I don't see how cats are anything like guys)
        <br><br>
        
        b) <b>Gym</b>: It gives you a good amount of dopamine (and morphine too). 
        You can notice it if you do it long enough&mdash;after a while you'll start to need exercise to feel normal. 
        However, it's very very hard to go overboard with exercise, so it's less likely you'll go into dangerous territories.  
        Plus exercise has a truckload of other benefits for your health, so it's a good thing to have a habit of.
        Finally, did I mention guys?
        Especially if you're lifting&mdash;the weight rooms are literal sausage fests&mdash;do whatever it takes to get your ass to the gym.
        <br><br>

        <!-- Also, seriously, if you're a girl and you don't go to a gym, you're missing out.
        Especially with weight-lifting.
        When I first started weight-lifting, I was terrified of seeing all the big, beefy dudes&mdash;I was very tiny in comparison.
        But soon, I realized that this is a goldmine&mdash;big daddies love helping out girls who need help ;)
        Trust me on this one, this actually does work.
        Plus hanging out with big daddies is also a great source of dopamine, so two birds with one stone. 
        <br><br> -->

        <!-- Perhaps the best anecdote I have of the benefits of going to a gym are was last summer, where the guy who managed the gym was one of the hottest people I'd ever seen.
        Like I looked at him and I thought "is it even legal for someone to be this hot?" 
        He was a bit awkward (was an engineering student before, so made sense&mdash;we're a pretty awkward bunch).
        Because of this, I figured if anyone had to make a move, it would have to be me.
        In hindsight, it wasn't the brightest idea, I was already seeing 3 other guys so it would have been more work to squeeze him in. 
        But anyways, most of my dating decisions are made in "fuck it" mode, so I tried to go for it regardless.
        So I went to the gym <b>every single day</b> with a plan of asking him out.
        I would talk to him, but sadly was too chicken to make a move. 
        But because I was so consistent at going, I got so much better at weight-lifting that summer.
        I felt like the kid who used the wrong formula to answer a question but still got the right answer, but hey, if it works, it works!
        <br><br> -->

        c) <b>Socializing</b>: Having a solid network of friends really adds a lot of value to life.
        I prioritize having deeper connections with a smaller group of people, rather than shallow ones with many&mdash;it feels nice to be really there for people, and to also have people in your corner when you need them.
        Go out there, make memories with your friends! Fuck it, life is short so make sure you make the most of it. 
        <br><br>

        d) <b>Adventures:</b> I make most descisions outside of my profession in "fuck it" mode. 
        When I look back at my life, I want to see myself having actually have had fun.
        The crazier the idea, the likiler I am to do it.
        And so I try doing as many crazy, stupid (but not too stupid) things that I can&mdash;and don't forget pictures for the memories!
        Go to clubs to check out guys, hack things just for laughs, messing around with friends, trolling people, etc.
        <br><br>

        <!-- e) <b>Clubbing:</b> I usually go clubbing either with guys, or to check out guys, or to dance, and honestly all three of give you a very good dopamine release.
        <br><br>

        f) <b>Trolling and pranking:</b> Honestly, trolling people in online games, or in real life has to be one of the purest joys out there.
        <br><br> -->

        e) <b>Projects:</b> Doing small projects that have a well-defined endpoint.
        Remember, these are side-projects, so you need to make sure they're small, so you get your gratification soon.
        It needs to be something accomplishable, so you don't get disheartened midway.
        I like to do artsy stuff&mdash;paint, crochet, design logos, work on this blog, etc.
        These are all skills that are of personal value to me and make me happy too.
        <br><br>
        
        f) <b>Goals:</b> I believe life has no inherent meaning&mdash;we attribute meaning to it through our goals.
        You need to have some direction in life at every moment for you to not feel lost.
        This direction doesn't necessarily have to be something static&mdash;it can change as your life changes.
        It merely needs to serve as a roadmap to guide you through life at <b>that</b> moment in time.
        When things change, so can your roadmap, but it's important to always have one to begin with.
        <br><br>

        Not all your life goals should be something that has an end, because once you reach that end you'll be faced with an existential crisis that's hard to handle.
        You need to have goals whose <b>journey</b> you enjoy, and not just the destination.
        For instance, one of my goals is to be able to run a 5 minute mile&mdash;I probably will never be able to accomplish it, but I love working towards it!
        Similarly, you should never have just one goal, or just one thing that gives your life meaning&mdash;if something bad happens with regards to this goal, you'll be left feeling lost.
        So have other goals to cushion yourself against this.

        <span id="para">Don't do this</span>
        <br><br>

        a) <b>Sugar: </b> Sugar is known to have a strong dopaminergic affect, and a lot of people have trouble with managining it. 
        Don't believe me? 
        Try quitting and see how it goes.
        This is also why, when people are sad, they often "eat their feelings"&mdash;it gives you an instant dopamine hit.
        There are theories that because food was relatively scarce back when we were hunter gatherers, we evolved to like higher calorie foods.
        But it's very easy for it to go out of hand, and dextrose (table sugar) is a horrible molecule for the body so I just stopped eating it.
        <br><br>
        
        b) <b>Masturbation:</b> If you masturbate too much, you're just desensitizing yourself so when you get the real-deal, you won't enjoy it as much. 
        Or worse, you could become plain addicted to masturbating&mdash;I have definitely seen people who are 100% addicted, and it's not very something you want. 
        <br><br>

        c) <b>Porn:</b> Same as b) pretty much 
        <br><br>

        d) <b>Processed food:</b> Highly processed foods are <b>made</b> to be addictive, so it's practically a losing battle with them.
        Plus it's horrible for your health, and if you do enough other fun things you don't really miss it.
        <br><br>

        e) <b>Drugs:</b> This is kind of obvious, but just adding it for completness sake.
        <br><br>

        <span id="para">Addiction swapping</span>
        <br><br>

        People who get addicted to things easily often try to "solve" their addiction by swapping it with another addiction.
        For instance, some drug addicts who sober up sometimes become food addicts, or porn addicts, or something else to fill that void.
        Or likewise, for example, someone obsessed with video games to an unhealthy extent could suddenly quit and become addicted to a new hobby.
        It's just something to be mindful of.
        <br><br>

        <span id="prompt">fork-while-1@github.io<span id="colon">:</span><span id="tilda">~</span><span id="dolla">$</span></span> 
        <span id="para">Anhedonia</span>
        <br><br>

        The more you abuse the dopaminergic system, the more you become desensitized to feeling pleasure. 
        When this gets really extreme, you end up with a condition called <b>Anhedonia</b>. <b>An</b> means without, and <b>hedonia</b> comes from the word hedonism, which refers to the act of doing things for the pleasure&mdash;<b>Anhedonia</b> is the condition where you stop being able to experience pleasure from anything. 
        This typically happens to people who chronically abuse dopaminergic drugs (like Meth, Coke, Adderall, etc) or people who have diseases like Parkinsons. 
        I've never experienced it myself, but from what I've heard, it feels like nothing makes you happy anymore, and you're kind of just getting through life.
        If you're at this point, you might want to consider laying off whatever got your brain used to that much dopamine in the first place to help it recover.
