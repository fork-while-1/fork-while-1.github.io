        I am not a doctor. 
        I am a random woman, and these are my two cents on life. 
        This is merely a blog I have on things that have helped me personally, or people who are close to me, or just stuff I find interesting. 
        Please use this for educational purposes only, and always talk to a licensed health-care professional for any definitive health advice. <br><br>

        <span id="para">Why this blog</span><br>

        Being in tech for around 7 years now, I've come to realize how pretty much everything can be optimized. 
        And after a long struggle with various issues, and watching other people struggle with their own issues, a couple years ago I finally came to the realization that the same goes with your life. 
        Since then, one of my main hobbies has been optimizing various aspects of my life&mdash;mood, happiness, physical health, and just overall well-being. 
        Life is too short to not live it to your fullest, hence my decision to milk the most from it! <br>
        Of course, almost everyone will tell you to start with the basics&mdash;eat healthy, exercise, sleep well, etc. 
        However, there is much more to the art of optimization than this, and there are a lot of quick fixes that don't take as much effort as the steps listed above, but will, over-time, make a noticeable difference in the quality of your life. 
        And by noticeable, I <b>really</b> mean noticeable&mdash;my personal life has had a night and day difference from what it used to be.<br>

        The rest of this blog will be organized in small articles that cover different aspects of life, and will include steps I or people I know follow to optimize those aspects. 
        Note that this is not meant to be a comprehensive blog, it's just something I work on in my free time.
