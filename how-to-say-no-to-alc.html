        Read <a href="index.html">this</a> before you move on.
        Note that I am not a doctor, and I am not offering medical advice.
        This is just stuff I've learnt in the past couple years that I hope someone else might find intersting/useful.

        <br><br>
        Unfortunately, alcohol today is a widely accepted part of socializing.
        Too accepted, if you ask me&mdash;accepted to the point that if you <b>don't</b> drink, it's considered weird.
        I no longer drink, but, time and again, I've been in situations where I have to say no to alcohol being offered to me without really wanting to explain the full story.
        There's many reasons why someone wouldn't want to talk about it: 
        <br><br>

        a) It's a sensitive issue, 
        <br><br>

        b) The person you're talking to most likely won't understand where you're coming from, 
        <br><br>

        c) It's too exhausting to have to explain it to every single person,
        <br><br>

        d) You want to keep the conversation light-hearted (e.g., on dates).
        <br><br>

        You might find yourself in situations like this many times&mdash;hanging out with friends, first dates, sometimes even official events like conference after parties.
        And you're not obligated to have to explain everything to everyone. 
        Because of this, I've had to come up with a list of excuses that I like to lean on.
        A good excuse is one that shuts people up, so that they leave you alone.
        I've also talked about this extensively with friends who've shared their own ways to go about this, and so I'm writing this article to share our collective knowledge.

        <span id="para">The excuses</span>
        <br><br>
        
        a) My favorite go-to reason is "I'm on meds I can't mix with alcohol". 
        This is nice because it's not technically a full-blown lie (i.e., the meds I take shouldn't be mixed with alcohol but people do it anyways).
        As horrible as it sounds, some people still push you to drink&mdash;"oh one drink won't hurt ya".
        And to those I say (sarcastically, of course) "sure, as long as you pay for the ambulance and the ER bill when the alcohol does interact with my meds".
        There'll also be those who're like "ooh which meds are you on? Are you on Accutane?"
        So for those people, have some meds with dosages ready: 
        <br><br>

        - Accutane (for acne), a typical dose is 40mg/day. 
        But you can't take Accutane forever so it won't work with people you plan on meeting frequently. 
        <br><br>

        - Allegra (for allergies) - 180 mg daily. 
        This one you can take for long periods, but it doesn't cause a severe reaction when mixed with alcohol so it might not be convincing enough.
        But unless the people you're talking to are absolute jerks, you can say it and people will back off.
        If you want, you can also use the chemical name (Fexofenadine) so that it sounds fancy and will get people scared.
        <br><br>

        - Flagyl (antibiotic) (500mg / day).
        This <b>will</b> cause a severe reaction when mixed with alcohol, but since it is an antibiotic so you won't be on it for too long. 
        <br><br>

        - Blood thinners like Coumadin (cardiac issues). 
        A typical dose could be around 3mg / day. 
        Mixing blood-thinners with alcohol can have life-threatening consequences, but using this as an excuse might raise more questions that it answers (e.g., "OMG are you okay? Why are you on blood thinners?")
        <br><br>
        
        b) If you're in a bar or a club, and a guy comes up to you and asks if he can buy you a drink&mdash;you can say you've already had enough for the night.
        Or you could look him straight in the eye and tell him you're pregnant (lol, obviously this one's just for the ladies).
        I've actually asked some of my guy friends how they'd react if a girl they were interested in said this, and honestly that they'd back off, so I'm pretty sure it'll work.
        Also wards off the creeps who keep trying to talk to you, so this is a good one.
        <br><br>
        
        c) You can also say something like "I don't drink <b>anymore</b>", implying that you've been there, done that and something happened that made you decide to quit.
        This usually gives the conversation an ominous turn&mdash;I once said this and the entire room of people became deathly quiet.

        d) Scar the people who won't take no for an answer.
        Come up with some extremely scarring story (could be made up if you don't want to share or have one to share).
        You could keep it vague and say you don't want to talk more about it.

        e) You could say you're more health concious now.
        Most people will not understand the gravity with which you say that sentence, so it may not always work.
        If they still try to push you throw in another random reason.

        f) If someone calls you a nerd or says something mean for not drinking, you could say something like: "oh don't worry sweetie, I promise you I can be more fun sober than you'll ever be drunk", and then drop the mic.
        I am usually nice to people, and like to solve issues in a peaceful manner, but if someone is hostile towards me, I won't back down.
        Especially when it's none of their business whether you get a drink or not.

        <span id="para">A couple extra tips</span>
        <br><br>

        a) Another place alcohol comes up a lot is dating. 
        A lot of first dates tend to be over drinks, so it's a lot of guys way of asking girls out.
        Because of this, I usually find some way to bring it up early on before we decide on a date, just so the guy knows.
        And if the guy says something like "oh you won't even drink wine? Not even one glass?", I'll just ghost them.
        I don't care how hot you are, or whatever else you have going for you, this is not something I mess around with. 
        <br><br>
        
        b) Have friends who also don't drink so you don't have to constantly keep your guard up, or feel left out.
